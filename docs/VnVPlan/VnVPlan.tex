\section{General Information}


\subsection{Summary}

In this document, we explain how Truss Tool is being tested. Truss Tool is software for truss analysis. Users can define a specific truss, by giving the exact location of the joints, members, supports and external forces.  Truss Tool calculates the reaction of the supports and internal forces. 

\subsection{Objectives}

Our objective is to build confidence in the software's correctness and increase its reliability. The functional requirements will be tested according to section 5.1, and Non-functional requirements will be tested according to section 5.2. We do not measure usability for this project. In this phase, we did not develop a graphical visualization for the truss. The usability will be considered when a graphical module is added to the project.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
Relevant documentation can be found by providing direct links. The VnV plan is highly related to the VnV report and we will report the results of the designed test in that document. Please see the Problem statement for goal definition and the SRS document for requirement analysis.

\section{Plan}
In this section, we explain the VnV plan of Truss Tool. The first section will introduce the VnV team members and their roles in the project's verification. Next, the verification plans of the SRS, design, the VnV verification plan, implementation, automated testing, and software validation plan are given. For static analysis, we use Pylint library of Python as a code inspection. 

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team} \label{VTeam}
The VnV team members and their roles are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Maryam Valian reviews the whole project as the author.}
\item {Dr.\  Smith reviews the whole project as supervisor.}
\item{Lesley Wheat reviews the whole project as the domain expert.}
\item{Joachim de Fourestier reviews the VnV plan as the secondary reviewer.}
\item{Jason Balaci reviews the MIS as the secondary reviewer.}
\item{Zehong Wong failed to review the SRS as the secondary reviewer.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan} \label{SRSvplan}
The SRS will be reviewed by  Smith and Lesely Wheat. Reviewers can give feedback and revision suggestions to the author by creating issues on GitHub. It is the author's responsibility to check the submitted issues regularly and make necessary modifications.

\subsection{Design Verification Plan} \label{Sec_Design_verific}

The design document MIS will be reviewed by Dr.\  Smith, Lesley Wheat and Jason Balaci. Reviewers can give feedback and revision suggestions to the author by creating issues on GitHub. It is the author's responsibility to check the submitted issues regularly and make necessary modifications.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan} \label{Sec_VofVnV}
The VnV plan document will be reviewed by Dr.\  Smith, Lesley Wheat and Joachim de Fourestier. Reviewers can give feedback and revision suggestions to the author by creating issues on GitHub. It is the author's responsibility to check the submitted issues regularly and make necessary modifications.
\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan} \label{Sec_implementation}
The implementation of the software will be verified using several techniques involving manual or automated interactions. The software will be developed in Python programming language. The code evaluation will involve unit and system testing. The tools for the
evaluations will be mentioned in section \ref{sec_automat}. Furthermore, the test cases used in system and unit testing will be stated in sections \ref{sec_systest} and \ref{sec_unitest}, respectively.

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools} \label{sec_automat}
Truss Tool will be tested and verified by Pytest as an automated tool for unit testing and system testing. Automated testing will be implemented for individual units as well as the integrated system.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
 Validation is the process of comparing the outputs of models to experimental values. The validation of the Truss Tool cannot be measured because we don't have real experimental data. 
\section{System Test Description} \label{sec_systest}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}
The functional requirements are described in the \href{https://github.com/Maryamvalian/project741/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}. Truss Tool will detect invalid inputs and assure that the calculated outputs are correct. Testing R1 and R2 will be explained in the input verification section. R3 and R4 will be explained in the output verification test. 
\subsubsection{Input Verification}
The inputs will be tested to satisfy R1 and R2 from Truss Tool SRS. Specifically, this test will ensure values of the inputs align with the input constraints. Table \ref{tbl_tc} displays the inputs and outputs of test cases for the input constraints tests.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}
The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Every time a component is changed, the items in the column of that component that is marked with an X may have to be modified as well. Table \ref{tbl_tr_TC} shows which test cases are supporting which requirements.

\section{Unit Test Description} \label{sec_unitest}

%\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall   philosophy for test case selection.}  
In this section, we explain our overall philosophy of test case selection. The main idea is to divide test cases to two categories: the first one to check input verification module and the second to verify the correctness of the output validation module. for more detailed information about design and modules please check 
\href{https://github.com/Maryamvalian/project741/blob/de6c2a97c2152f912c1ed33a18b693b2e031ab56/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{MIS Document}.

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}
In this project, we use Scipy library of Python to solve our linear equations. Testing this library is not in the scope of this document and we trust its results. For unit testing we use Pytest to automatically check modules.


\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements} 


\subsubsection{Input parameters Module} \label{t_in}


\begin{enumerate}

\item{Input parameter\\}

Type:  Automatic
					
Initial State: Truss Tool is running.
					
Input: import input.txt
					
Output: assert = True

Test Case Derivation: The parameters inputted by the user should 
match the state variable from Inputs Module. An assert statement
will return True if these are equal.

How test will be performed: with help of Pytest Library.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Calculation Module} \label{t_cal}


\begin{enumerate}

\item{Caclulate react module\\}

Type:  Automatic
					
Initial State: Truss Tool is running.
					
Input: import input.txt
					
Output: assert = True

Test Case Derivation: Test Case Derivation: Outputs of the system should match the values
calculated by an online software \cite{valdivia}. An assert statement
will return True if the mean error between calculated outputs and
expected outputs is less than $0.1$

How test will be performed: with help of Pytest Library.
 \item{Caclulate Internals module\\} 

Type:  Automatic
					
Initial State: Truss Tool is running.
					
Input: import input.txt
					
Output: assert = True

Test Case Derivation: Test Case Derivation: Outputs of the system should match the values
calculated by an online software \cite{valdivia}. An assert statement
will return True if the mean error between calculated outputs and
expected outputs is less than $0.1$

How test will be performed: with help of Pytest Library.   

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Output Module} \label{t_out}


\begin{enumerate}

\item{Outputs\\}

Type:  Automatic
					
Initial State: Truss Tool is running.
					
Input: import input.txt
					
Output: Generates output.txt

Test Case Derivation: Outputs should include all the calculated support reactions and internal forces.

How test will be performed: Manually checking the file output.txt in the Src folder.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}
Testing nonfunctional requirements of units is not required for Truss. Tests
for nonfunctional requirements of system are introduced in section 5.2.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Modules}
The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed. Table 
shows the dependencies between the test cases and the all of designed modules except the modules that are implemented by the operating system or Python.


\begin{tabular}{l l} 
  \toprule		
  \textbf{Test Cases} & \textbf{Modules}\\
  \midrule

  \ref{t_cal} & React Module\\
  \ref{t_cal} & Internal Module\\
  \ref{t_out} & Outputs Module\\
